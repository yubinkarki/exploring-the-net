## Session One Exercises

Some coding exercises based on the topics that were discussed in class from the first session.  
The first session covers ideas from the second unit.

### Using the 'is' and 'as' operators

```
Create a nullable string variable.
Use the is operator to check if the variable has a value.
Use the as operator to safely access the string value, handling potential null values.
```

### Combining string interpolation and literal string interpretation

```
Write to the console the following message:
"This is a copyright symbol {copyright}
but this {trademark} is interpreted literally."
Where copyright is dynamic and trademark should be interpreted as is.
```
