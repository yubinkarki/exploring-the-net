## Session One Exercises

Some coding exercises based on the topics that were discussed in class from the first session.  
The first session covers ideas from the first half of the second unit.

### 1. Type-testing with the 'is' operator

```
Create two different empty classes Teacher and Student. 
Created a method that takes an argument of type object.
Use conditional logic to check if the object is of type Teacher or Student.
Print appropriate message to the console for Teacher, Student and neither cases.

Hint: 'nameof' method can be used to get the name of the data.
```

### 2. Check highest number using ternary

```
1. Given two numbers, return the highest number. 0 if both numbers are equal.
2. Use ternary operator to determine the highest number among three numbers.
```

### 3. Rectangular array sum

```
Initialize a rectangular int array with 2 rows and 3 columns with positive values.
Calculate the sum of all elements in each row and print the output in the following format:
> Result of row 1 = 6
> Result of row 2 = 15
```
