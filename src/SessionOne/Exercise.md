## Session One Exercises

Some coding exercises based on the topics that were discussed in class from the first session.  
The first session covers ideas from the second unit.

### Using the 'is' and 'as' operators

```
Create a nullable string variable.
Use the is operator to check if the variable has a value.
Use the as operator to safely access the string value, handling potential null values.
```

### Combining string interpolation and literal string interpretation

```
Write to the console the following message:
"This is a copyright symbol {copyright}
but this {trademark} is interpreted literally."
Where copyright is dynamic and trademark should be interpreted as is.
```

### Type-testing with the 'is' operator

```
Create two different empty classes Teacher and Student. 
Created a method that takes an argument of type object.
Use conditional logic to check if the object is of type Teacher or Student.
Print appropriate message to the console for Teacher, Student and neither cases.

Hint: 'nameof' method can be used to get the name of the data.
