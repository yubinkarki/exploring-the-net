## Unit 1 - Introducing C# and the .NET Framework

.NET is a free, cross-platform, open-source developer platform for building many kinds of applications  
It can run programs written in multiple languages, with C# being the most popular  
It relies on a high-performance runtime that is used in production by many high-scale apps

|          | Functional Decomposition                   | Object-Oriented Programming                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Approach | Divides system into smaller functions      | Divides system into objects that represent entities   |
| Focus    | Emphasis on functions that operate on data | Emphasis on objects that hold data and their behavior |

## Unit 2 - The C# Language Basics

When compiling to managed code, the C# compiler translates your source code into Intermediate Language (IL)  
The IL is a CPU-independent set of instructions that can be efficiently converted to native code  
JIT compilation converts IL to native code on demand at application run time
